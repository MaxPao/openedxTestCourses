<p>Up to now, you have shown the sales figures in the Pivot table. These figures dynamically change according to the filtered context. The totals for sales is an implicit measure.&nbsp;You are now interested to see what the margin % of the product by country is. You will need to create an explicit measure to show the margin %.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Create an explicit measure named <strong>Margin</strong> in the <strong>FactInternetSales</strong> table. This measure calculates the percent profit, which is the total revenue minus the total cost, and divide it by the total cost.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Format the <strong>Margin</strong> measure as a %.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Add this newly created measure to the Pivot table.</span></li>
</ol>
