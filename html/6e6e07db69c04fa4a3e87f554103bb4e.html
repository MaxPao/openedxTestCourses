<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">This course is created using Excel 2016&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">Professional Plus</span><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">&nbsp;edition. If you are using supported editions listed above, you should be able to complete the labs in this&nbsp;course, although if you are not using Excel 2016, there may be subtle interface differences and you might need to perform a little workaround. If you are using Excel 2010, we provide separate lab files for you, so please pay attention in the lab section.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">If your Excel installation is not listed in the above list, you can follow the lectures and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">attempt the quizzes with just your browser, but to work on the labs you need to have a supported version /edition of Microsoft Excel on a Windows machine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">What to do if?</span></h2>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>I have Excel 2016 Professional Plus or standalone edition: Great! You can move on to the next section.</li>
<li>I have Excel 2013 Professional Plus or standalone edition: Review the&nbsp;notes<span style="line-height: 28.4444px;">&nbsp;</span>for using supported Excel 2013 for this course.</li>
<li>I have Excel 2010: Review the&nbsp;notes&nbsp;for using Excel 2010 for this course.</li>
<li>I do not have Excel installed: I'd&nbsp;suggest to install the trial&nbsp;version of Office 2016 Professional Plus.</li>
<li>I have Excel 2016, but not the edition supported for this course:&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 28.4444px;">I'd suggest to install the&nbsp;trial&nbsp;version of Office 2016 Professional Plus. If that is not an option, then review the notes&nbsp;for&nbsp;using non-supported Excel 2016 (outside the&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">Professional Plus or standalone edition) for this course.</span></li>
