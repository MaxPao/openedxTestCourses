<p>This lecture will review procedures to import data from a SQL database. Because Dany starts with an empty workbook and this process requires you to connect to a different server and different credentials than those being used in the lecture, there is no file provided for this lecture.&nbsp; You will have an opportunity to perform these steps on your own during the lab &ndash; you can refer back to the video as needed.&nbsp;</p>
