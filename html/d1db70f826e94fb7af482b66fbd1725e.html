<p class="MsoNormal">If you import some or all of your data from a data warehouse, or other type of relational database, chances are there is already a date table and relationships between it, and the rest of data you are importing. The dates and format will likely match the dates in your fact data, and the dates probably begin well in the past and go far out into the future. The date table you want to import may be very large and contain a range of dates beyond what you will need to include in your Data Model. You can use advanced filter features to selectively choose only the dates and the particular columns you really need. This can significantly reduce your workbook&rsquo;s size and improve performance. If your do not have a date table imported from your database, you can create one yourself.<o:p></o:p></p>
