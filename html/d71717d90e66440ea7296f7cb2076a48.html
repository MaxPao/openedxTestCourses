<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>VanArsdel is a company that manufactures and sells sporting goods. The company has offices in the United States (US) and several other countries. Its sales comprise of US sales and International sales. VanArsdel&rsquo;s sales come from its owned manufactured products, as well as other manufacturers&rsquo; products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VanArsdel's US&nbsp;office stores the sales data on a SQL Database on Microsoft Azure. This&nbsp;is a relational database service in the cloud based on the Microsoft SQL Server engine, with built-in, mission-critical capabilities. The following image shows the database diagram for the tables of your interest:<img width="863" height="404" alt="Database Diagram" src="/static/databasediagram.PNG" type="saveimage" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" ispropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" isdefaultprevented="function t(){return!1}" stopimmediatepropagation="function (){r.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n}" stoppropagation="function (){r.isPropagationStopped=n}" preventdefault="function (){r.isDefaultPrevented=n}" target="[object Object]" /></p>
<p>VanArsdel International sales transactions are available as comma separated (CSV) files. They could be generated daily, either manually by someone, or automatically by an automated process. They are available in a dedicated folder. These CSV files have the same column structure as the sales table for the US sales that comes from the SQL Database.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You want to perform analysis on VanArsdel's worldwide sales data for the year of 2015. You need to bring all these data into Excel before you can perform&nbsp;any analysis.</p>
<h2>Lab Overview</h2>
<p>This lab comprises of three&nbsp;exercises:</p>
<ol><ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">In the first exercise, you will import data to Microsoft Excel from a SQL database on Azure. Once you have imported the data, you will explore existing table relationships and create a new one yourself.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">In the second exercise, you will import data from CSV&nbsp;files which resides in a file folder. You will append this new data to the corresponding existing data that comes from the SQL Database.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">In the third exercise, you will create a Date&nbsp;table in the data model to be used for data analysis.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol></ol>
<p>Before starting this lab, you should review <strong>Module 4</strong> in this course. Then, if you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the Set up the Lab Environment section of this course to set up the lab environment.</p>
<h2>What You'll Need</h2>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">A computer with Microsoft Excel installed on it. We prefer Excel 2016, but you can still complete <em>much</em> of the lab using either Excel 2013 or Excel 2010. If you are using Excel 2013, we provide step-by-step instructions in a separate tab that should assist you with importing the data. If you use Excel 2010, separate workarounds for the first two questions however, unfortunately, there is no direct way to answer the third lab question through appending the two files together &ndash; the only way to come up with the answer is to add the number of rows together from the resulting two imports.</span></li>
