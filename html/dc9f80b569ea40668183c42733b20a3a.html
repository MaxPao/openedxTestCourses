<p><strong>Power Query and Power Pivot in Excel 2010</strong></p>
<p>In Excel 2010, you cannot bring the data directly to Power Pivot using Power Query. When you import data using Power Query, you can either import to Excel worksheet or only create a connection. And then,&nbsp;from the Power Pivot ribbon you can use<strong> Create Linked Table</strong> to add the table to the Power Pivot model.&nbsp;This method limits you to a bit more than 1 million rows in a table. In addition, this will make the size of the file larger than the equivalent in 2013 / 2016 because the data is stored both inside and outside the model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can bring data directly to Power Pivot using&nbsp;Power Pivot import data capabilities. Therefore, you can import millions of rows in the same way as in 2013 or 2016. However, you cannot use the data transformation features that comes with Power Query.</p>
<p>In this course we exclusively use Power Query for importing data so we have this limitation. However, for the purpose of the labs, you will be given an Excel file that already has the data in the data model. Therefore, you can still complete the labs using Excel 2010.</p>
<p><strong>Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts and Slicers</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Inserting new pivot tables and pivot charts which are based on the model can be done only from the Power Pivot window or the Power Pivot ribbon.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Slicers can be created from the field list by dragging columns to two special buckets called Slicer vertical and slicers horizontal.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">When you create a pivot chart from Power Pivot, you&rsquo;ll see a new sheet created with the pivot table behind the pivot chart. In 2010 you can&rsquo;t have a pivot chart without a pivot table.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">You can always hide the sheets that contain the pivot table.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>One last tidbit, every time you change something in the model you&rsquo;ll get a prompt in Excel to click for refresh.</p>
