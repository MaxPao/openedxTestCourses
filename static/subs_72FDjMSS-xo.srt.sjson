    "Remember we did some queries from text, we did queries from SQL,", 
    "combining with text and then we did some DAX,", 
    "and now I\u2019m going back to an example using queries.", 
    "In this example, let\u2019s switch to the Excel", 
    "screen, and look at this report.", 
    "In this report is not our target report.", 
    "It\u2019s not that we want to build this report.", 
    "The fact is that the scenario here is that", 
    "this is what we got as input.", 
    "This is the data we have.", 
    "And why is that?", 
    "This is kind of typical in many organizations.", 
    "In some cases, you have access to a very nice data warehouse.", 
    "And you\u2019re a business analyst and", 
    "you get access to the data warehouse.", 
    "And you know the data warehouse and everything\u2019s fine.",

    "you still have access to some", 
    "tool that will export the data you need into text files.", 
    "And you use these text files, maybe multiple of them, you combine them,", 
    "we saw how to create relationships, have multiple tables.", 
    "Great.", 
    "But in other cases maybe you don\u2019t even have that.", 
    "The only thing you have is a reporting system", 
    "that creates this report, nice looking headers, repeating headers.", 
    "It has data for", 
    "each month, you see January through December going across the rows.", 
    "And you want to create some analysis of your own based on this.", 
    "But you don\u2019t have access to the data behind it.", 
    "So what we have to do is to use this as our input.", 
    "Looks pretty difficult when you look at it and if you", 
    "think about how to do this in Excel, you are up to some real challenges.", 
    "And not only it\u2019s challenging to make from this data some useful", 
    "format or useful shape that you can use to create your own analyses, but", 
    "also you are thinking about the number of times you will have to", 
    "repeat the steps of creating from this a useful thing.", 
    "So if you are a VBA person you might think of writing some complex", 
    "sophisticated macro to do this conversion.", 
    "If you\u2019re not you\u2019re just counting your copy paste operations,", 
    "how many times you will have to do it, and how many errors.", 
    "And maybe thinking of,", 
    "can you offload this work to someone else and not have to repeat it.", 
    "So let\u2019s see how Excel, 2016 in this case, Power Query", 
    "As is embedded in the previous version, can help you to use this and", 
    "make it into a useful data to do your analysis.", 
    "So I can close this because this is not the file that I\u2019m going to use.", 
    "I\u2019m going to actually create an empty file.", 
    "And go here and create myself a new query.", 
    "The query will be from file and the file is an Excel file.", 
    "And the file is called Report.", 
    "I click on it, actually the query now reads this data,", 
    "shows me there is something called Sheet1.", 
    "It reads the data, shows me the preview,", 
    "which is not very encouraging because it has all kinds", 
    "of things which I know I need to fix before I can use it.", 
    "But I click on the edit and I\u2019m hopeful that the query will help me.", 
    "Again it tells me that there\u2019s a preview cache and it\u2019s six days old.", 
    "I can refresh it.", 
    "It doesn\u2019t matter because anyhow the data haven\u2019t changed,", 
    "but I can go ahead and refresh the preview.", 
    "So now I started to look at this data and", 
    "identify what do I need to do.", 
    "I see that there are two rows here in the front that definitely", 
    "seem to be, I don\u2019t need these rows, so I want to remove them.", 
    "I go to the transformation and I see that there is one for removing rows.", 
    "I can do both top rows, bottom rows, here in this case top rows.", 
    "So the first top row.", 
    "How many top rows did I want to remove?", 
    "Just two.", 
    "Gone.", 
    "Now I\u2019m actually at this", 
    "row now that it\u2019s going to be useful to use as the headers for", 
    "the table that is going to be eventually created from that.", 
    "So now I can go and", 
    "click on the transformation called Use First Row as Headers.", 
    "You see that it kind of promoted the first row, and uses it for headers.", 
    "Now, you see that because of the report, if you remember the way it", 
    "was, the category is in row one.", 
    "Then, this column is empty, and", 
    "then there is the total for this category, and so on.", 
    "So, what I can do, first of all, every", 
    "row that contains the value, the word total, I want to filter it out.", 
    "Because the totals, I don\u2019t need them.", 
    "So, Text Filters &gt;Does Not Contain.", 
    "I want only if the value does not contain the word Total.", 
    "So this will take care of all the totals and they will go away.", 
    "Oh actually I think I, let me just look again at this.", 
    "I can click on this parameters.", 
    "Does not show.", 
    "Oh, okay, okay, I just, let me.", 
    "So, once I realized that there is a mistake here,", 
    "that a lot of rows disappeared on me.", 
    "And so what I can do is actually I can delete this last step and", 
    "get back to where I was.", 
    "So, we saw before that we can go back,", 
    "insert new rows in the steps, and I can also delete,", 
    "this is like I\u2019m doing, but I\u2019m doing here is much simpler.", 
    "It\u2019s just deleting the operation that you don\u2019t want.", 
    "So let\u2019s do it in a different sequence.", 
    "So first I want to actually fill the values for", 
    "the categories on all these empty rows.", 
    "So that the value for", 
    "Mix would be filled down on all the empty rows below it.", 
    "So there is a transformation that\u2019s called Fill.", 
    "And I will select the column and", 
    "this column I want to do a Fill &gt;Down.", 
    "So now you see that I have the Mix spread", 
    "until the Total, and then in the same way", 
    "I have all the others in the field down.", 
    "But I still have the totals, the rows that have the totals.", 
    "So now, I want to apply Does Not Contain.", 
    "So I don\u2019t want the rows that have the word Total in them.", 
    "Okay, done.", 
    "And you see that this is an iterative process.", 
    "You apply something, you see the result, sometimes you may need to go", 
    "back and redo it in a different way, there\u2019s no clear answer.", 
    "It\u2019s a complex kind of input and", 
    "you gradually clean it until it gets to the shape that you need it.", 
    "Another thing is that there were headers, repeating headers.", 
    "So the first row of headers I\u2019ve used as headers for my report.", 
    "But the rest of the headers, I need to get rid of.", 
    "So as an example of this header is this row number nine that has", 
    "the word Category in it.", 
    "So again I can say I want to text filter where everything,", 
    "I just want the rows that do not contain the word Category.", 
    "So we are gradually getting rid of all the rows we don\u2019t need.", 
    "So now it seems that we got rid of all the rows.", 
    "But we have a major obstacle here.", 
    "We have columns for each month, from January to December.", 
    "So 12 columns with values.", 
    "Actually there\u2019s an extra column here that is empty so", 
    "I\u2019m going to remove it.", 
    "There is a total for the year which I also don\u2019t need and", 
    "I\u2019m going to remove it.", 
    "So now I\u2019m left with the Category, the Manufacturer and the values for", 
    "each combination of category and manufacturer for each month.", 
    "But the fact that I have a column for", 
    "each month is nice for the report, but it\u2019s really not good for", 
    "me to use to creating pivot tables in analysis.", 
    "What I need is actually a column that will contain the name", 
    "of the month, and another column that will contain the value.", 
    "So I need to flatten it.", 
    "Instead of having multiple columns for each month,", 
    "I want each one of these columns to become a row.", 
    "So, let\u2019s see how can I do it.", 
    "So, I can select from January to December, by Shift + click.", 
    "I selected all these columns.", 
    "And, I can apply a transformation that is called Unpivot.", 
    "The Unpivot, and one simple click created for me two columns.", 
    "So everything that used to be column now becomes row, so for", 
    "each combination of category and manufacturer, now we have a row for", 
    "January, February, March and so on.",
