    "Hello everyone my name is Dany Hoter and", 
    "I\u2019m a Senior Program Manager in the Excel team in Microsoft.", 
    "And this course is going to be about analyzing and", 
    "visualizing data in Excel.", 
    "Actually I\u2019m gonna use Excel 2016.", 
    "Originally it was supposed to be with Excel 2016, but", 
    "we decided to just call it with Excel.", 
    "Because you\u2019ll be able to follow this not only with Excel 2016 but", 
    "also with Excel 2013 and", 
    "with a little bit more difficulty also with Excel 2010.", 
    "Now, I\u2019m gonna be covering areas of importing data into Excel,", 
    "creating models of data in Excel and", 
    "using new tools that were added to Excel in the last versions.", 
    "Let\u2019s go straight into our first module.", 
    "And in this module, actually I\u2019m going to show you", 
    "things which are not necessarily new.", 
    "I\u2019m gonna show you data analysis using data in Excel,", 
    "in the grid of Excel.", 
    "And most of you will be, hopefully familiar to you but", 
    "I\u2019m going to cover it and", 
    "then show the differences between this classic way of analyzing data", 
    "and the new tools that I\u2019m going to show you in for the modules.", 
    "So let me open my first file here in Excel and", 
    "let\u2019s understand how people are doing data", 
    "Analysis and Excel for years.", 
    "All right so what do you see here is at least my take", 
    "on a classic dashboard in Excel, it had three pivot charts.", 
    "Two slicers, right here.", 
    "Three pivot charts.", 
    "And the slicers are connected to all the pivot charts, so", 
    "if I click here on accessories, all the three charts respond.", 
    "I can select one, I can select multiple.", 
    "And the data for this,", 
    "what you see here is actually in the, I can hide,", 
    "I can unhide some of the data here.", 
    "And you\u2019ll see that actually all the data is right here in Excel.", 
    "The data came into Excel, let me unhide also the others because there", 
    "are multiple tables here that contain the data.", 
    "And this is kind of typical that the data is contained in a few", 
    "ranges in Excel.", 
    "But the author who created this support needed to combine", 
    "all the data into one consecutive range of data.", 
    "Because pivot tables and pivot charts, like I was using here.", 
    "Needs all the data to be in one range.", 
    "So, the first columns here are going all the way from A to E.", 
    "The original data that contains transactions.", 
    "And then, all the columns coming from F to L", 
    "are columns that are actually bringing data from the other", 
    "tables into this table to make it one big table.", 
    "And for that, the Excel user uses one", 
    "of the oldest tools in Excel, the Vlookup function.", 
    "So this is actually using two Vlookups,", 
    "this is using another Vlookup.", 
    "I will not go into the details of explaining to you how to", 
    "use Vlookup, because it is not really the purpose of this course", 
    "to teach you about Vlookup.", 
    "But just as a quick reminder, Vlookup provides a key to another table.", 
    "In this case,", 
    "it\u2019s the customer and then the table is the customer\u2019s table.", 
    "And then it tells you, in this case, to bring column number five and", 
    "false tells Vlookup expression to look for an exact match and", 
    "not just not exact match.", 
    "Now it may seem a little different from Vlookup you", 
    "saw before if you haven\u2019t been using tables in Excel.", 
    "In this example I\u2019m using tables this is why it\u2019s formatted", 
    "this way and also this is why the expressions use column names and", 
    "table names instead of a regular reference to Excel.", 
    "If you don\u2019t use tables I would recommend really to look at it.", 
    "They\u2019ve been around for quite some time in Excel, since 2007, and", 
    "they are a great tool.", 
    "And it makes for much more readable", 
    "formulas and also easier to maintain formulas.", 
    "Now let\u2019s go back to our dashboard.", 
    "So pretty much you see that I can get nice results.", 
    "The dashboard at least to my standards, looks pretty nice.", 
    "So what\u2019s wrong in this picture and", 
    "why did we need to introduce new tools into Excel in", 
    "the latest versions, to go beyond what I was able to do here?", 
    "So the challenges here are the following.", 
    "First of all the need to combine all the data together with Vlookups.", 
    "It has its flaws, its problems.", 
    "First of all, Vlookups can get very slow.", 
    "Let me give an example here.", 
    "If for any reason I go to the customer\u2019s table", 
    "that I bring data from into the main table, the sales table, and", 
    "I go here and I just change one cell, let\u2019s say this guy.", 
    "Marital status of this customer, change from single to married.", 
    "Also means that this guy married.", 
    "If you notice in the bottom, in the status line it says calculating and", 
    "it has a progress bar.", 
    "Going, going, going.", 
    "Still going.", 
    "And only now all the calculations were actually completed.", 
    "The reason that it\u2019s a simple operation of changing", 
    "one cell took so long is because this range is used in thousands and", 
    "thousands of Vlookup expressions, and all of them needed to be calculated.", 
    "So, vlookups can be slow.", 
    "And this is slow, it can be actually a lot slower.", 
    "And now vlookups can also be difficult to maintain and", 
    "can be error prone.", 
    "Another problem is that the data that we use", 
    "is not always as simple as this one.", 
    "Here the only problem was to combine it to one range.", 
    "But many times I need to do much more operations on the data to", 
    "manipulate, to shape it, to make it ready to be used in analysis.", 
    "And in order to do that the Excel user had some tools,", 
    "you could use manual copy and", 
    "paste operations, you can create some macros if you knew how to.", 
    "You can use SQL to manipulate the data on the SQL side if you knew", 
    "how to.", 
    "But none of these solutions was really easy and", 
    "accessible for Excel users.", 
    "And if you did some manual operations you had to repeat them", 
    "every period.", 
    "Let\u2019s say if the report is weekly, you had to repeat this every week.", 
    "And this became really, really tedious,", 
    "and people really did not like it.", 
    "So manipulating and making the data ready to go is another thing.", 
    "The third one is scale.", 
    "The Excel grid is a maximum of a million rows and for", 
    "many cases this is not enough.", 
    "And even if you go to half a million and", 
    "still have columns with Vlookup, it would be terribly slow.", 
    "So being able to manipulate millions of rows", 
    "is not something that a regular Excel user would", 
    "be able to do with regular Excel like this.", 
    "So in order to solve these issues and", 
    "another one that I want to mention is that some data sources", 
    "are not really accessible to native Excel.", 
    "So some modern Data sources let\u2019s say if data is coming from Facebook,", 
    "from Salesforce from other OData,", 
    "some of them are really not accessible to Excel and", 
    "people want to use a large variety of data sources.", 
    "To solve all these problems we actually", 
    "since 2010 have been providing new tools to Excel to be able", 
    "to first of all create pivot tables and pivot charts without needing to", 
    "combine the data physically into one large range.", 
    "So staying with multiple tables that you can use and", 
    "create pivot tables directly from.", 
    "Second, having a way to manipulate", 
    "the data in very powerful ways and a repeatable way.", 
    "You do it once you check the data.", 
    "Next time you need to import the same data you just click on a button", 
    "and it does everything for you.", 
    "So this is the third this -  scale.", 
    "Being able to get into Excel millions and", 
    "millions of rows, even tens of millions if you need to,", 
    "is another thing, and with very good performance.", 
    "And the last one, which actually I haven\u2019t mentioned as a deficiency", 
    "is about creating logic, business logic.", 
    "Here, I\u2019m using just one example, if you see here,", 
    "on this chart on the right side, there is a margin percent.", 
    "It\u2019s a dual axis chart on one side,", 
    "it\u2019s showing the margin percent and the other the revenue.", 
    "The margin percent is calculated from the revenue and the cost", 
    "with something called calculated field for the pivot table.", 
    "I won\u2019t even go and show to you exactly how to do it,", 
    "it\u2019s been there in Excel for many, many years.", 
    "But using calculated fields is very limited.", 
    "The level of sophistication for", 
    "the business logic you can create is very limited.", 
    "And the new tools that I\u2019m going to show you will make it possible for", 
    "you to create really, really sophisticated business logic and", 
    "do the calculations in a language that is similar to Excel,", 
    "but extends the capabilities of Excel.", 
    "So this is what we are going to do", 
    "in all the other modules coming from here.", 
    "I will show you the new tools, the new data modeling Excel,", 
    "the new language for calculations, the new tools for querying and", 
    "shaping the data.", 
    "So this is the end of this module and you",
