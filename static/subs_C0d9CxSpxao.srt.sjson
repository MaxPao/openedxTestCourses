    "Hello welcome back.", 
    "This is the second part of module five and", 
    "it\u2019s going to dive even more into the DAX language.", 
    "But in this part I will do it differently.", 
    "I will show you an example I created It has some pretty sophisticated", 
    "examples of DAX formulas, which I\u2019m going to show you.", 
    "I\u2019m not going to show you how to build them from scratch.", 
    "We\u2019re going to look at them as they are now.", 
    "And I\u2019m pretty sure that also", 
    "that very few of you will be able to just by watching it once just go and", 
    "create your own expressions at this level.", 
    "You will have access of course,", 
    "you\u2019ll be able to download all the examples I\u2019m using and", 
    "look at how, and look at them more closely and", 
    "gradually learn how to do similar things yourselves.", 
    "But I wanted to do just to kind of impress you with", 
    "the kind of complexity and", 
    "sophistication you can get when creating business logic using DAX.", 
    "So let\u2019s look at this example.", 
    "I have here an Excel file, I call it a full dashboard,", 
    "and it has actually three worksheets,", 
    "each one of them showing a business aspect or business", 
    "calculation that this business wants to look at periodically.", 
    "One is about year over year.", 
    "So this is, I\u2019m picking a year.", 
    "I can pick the last year or I can pick a previous year.", 
    "And onceI pick this year, first of all on the left side I see", 
    "a chart with the sales of all the years.", 
    "These sales do not, this chart here does not work with the slicer.", 
    "I can actually connect.", 
    "We\u2019ll see it in another module, how to use,", 
    "how to connect slicers to charts.", 
    "So this chart is not connected to the slicer, so", 
    "we chose all the years.", 
    "By the way, if you see this chart, there\u2019s a plus minus sign here.", 
    "If I click on the plus, it actually will drill into the level of months.", 
    "This plus and minus here are a new feature for Excel 2016.", 
    "There\u2019s also a slicer on country and there\u2019s another one which", 
    "actually slices the data because this, as you will see in a moment,", 
    "this dataset has data both for the company that is running this", 
    "analysis and also for its competitors.", 
    "It has some source for getting the competitor\u2019s total sales and", 
    "it can compare the market share.", 
    "Calculate the market share between their sales and others.", 
    "And the vendor here it just filters on the sales which I call our sales.", 
    "The main chart here is showing for the year that I selected, month", 
    "by month, the difference between this year and the year before.", 
    "There is a sentence here which I also built using formulas,", 
    "I will show it to you in a moment that says the total", 
    "between 2013 and 2015, the sales shrank 5%.", 
    "If I go here, you\u2019ll see there the sales between 2012 and", 
    "2013 grew 8% total.", 
    "So, I build this with a bunch of Excel expressions, some of them I", 
    "will explain, and all the data comes from the model.", 
    "And for each month you\u2019ll see that there are some months in which", 
    "the growth like here for March, there\u2019s a negative.", 
    "So there\u2019s less sales in March of 2013 than in March of 2012,", 
    "in the other months there is growth.", 
    "So month by month I can show you year over year comparisons.", 
    "So let\u2019s first look at the three of them and then I\u2019ll go to", 
    "the manage window and show some of the calculations that they use here.", 
    "So the second example is about calculating market share.", 
    "As I said, this data set has sales both for the company called", 
    "VanArsdale and its competitors, other manufacturers.", 
    "And I can see on", 
    "the left side there is a chart by country that shows in orange,", 
    "the sales for this company and in blue the sales for the competitors.", 
    "If I select from here a segment the chart will show.", 
    "For example, for", 
    "this segment, there\u2019s almost no sales for this company.", 
    "It\u2019s all competitors.", 
    "For this one it\u2019s actually, most of the sales are,", 
    "they kind of dominate this segment of the market and so on.", 
    "And again I can open it again for entire thing.", 
    "Here on the right side,", 
    "I can actually see another year over year comparison, but", 
    "this time of the year over year change in the market share.", 
    "So, you see that market share,", 
    "there was in 2012 that was better than before, in 2013.", 
    "2011 there is no data because there is the first date in this data set,", 
    "so it doesn\u2019t have any year over year comparisons.", 
    "In 2014 there actually was and also in 2015 there is actually", 
    "a drop in the market share compared to previous years, and", 
    "again it can be calculated for a specific or for", 
    "a specific segment or for all segments.", 
    "So this is the other aspect that they want to always look at, this is", 
    "their market share in the different areas that they operate in.", 
    "And the last one and", 
    "maybe the most advanced one is what I call expansion.", 
    "I have information here about sales for, as you remember,", 
    "we have zip codes in countries and every year they\u2019re", 
    "getting into new territories, selling into more zip codes,", 
    "which correspond to cities and states and so on.", 
    "So I want to show here how many new.", 
    "Locations by zip code they\u2019re selling for a specific country or", 
    "for all countries.", 
    "If I just click on USA, you\u2019ll see that, for", 
    "the first year of course have all the locations are new", 
    "because this is just the beginning of this data set.", 
    "But for 2012 there were over 4,000 new zip codes that had", 
    "some sales in this year but did not have any sales in the previous year.", 
    "When you look at the total locations you will see that", 
    "the total growth is actually negligible, because", 
    "as they were selling into new ones they were also, they had some", 
    "areas in which they had sales in the previous year and not in this year.", 
    "So, but all this, of course, is fictional data.", 
    "It just shows you the ability to calculate.", 
    "And this could be a thing about customers, acquiring customers.", 
    "How many customers do we have that have bought something in this", 
    "period, but nothing in the previous periods?", 
    "And I can also go and, on the pivot table,", 
    "now here I have a pivot table.", 
    "And I have pivot charts connected to it.", 
    "And they correspond to each other, so if I go here and", 
    "I click on the plus sign it will go and open up for months.", 
    "And also this chart with respond in the same way.", 
    "Now I see for each months how many new.", 
    "So if there is like, let\u2019s say in the U.S.", 
    "705 new zip codes that had registered some sales in March.", 
    "It means that those zip codes did not have any sales in any", 
    "one of the months in 2011 or in 2012 up to March.", 
    "So here it\u2019s acquiring territories by zip.", 
    "It could be the same way for customers, themselves.", 
    "And, also, in similar ways, you can calculate repeating customers,", 
    "customers that have bought in the previous period,", 
    "and also in the period that we are looking at.", 
    "So, they are repeating customers.", 
    "And, also, you can see customers that actually have bought something", 
    "in the past, but did not show up any new sales in this period.", 
    "So, this depends on the definition for each business.", 
    "It seems like these customers are actually lost.", 
    "So these are the three scenarios, and let\u2019s look at a few, at least,", 
    "of the examples of how do I calculate all these KPIs and", 
    "these things in DAX,", 
    "so here is the service table.", 
    "Oh, one more thing, that actually I was able to do, and", 
    "I didn\u2019t show up and tell you and it was here.", 
    "I have here a slicer that enables me to select for", 
    "the chart on the left side, how do I want to see?", 
    "Do I want to see as total percentage, or", 
    "do I want to see absolutely the sales for", 
    "all the competitors together and this company together?", 
    "So, two ways to see the same thing, selecting it from a slicer,", 
    "which is another technique I\u2019m using here to allow the user to", 
    "select things that will affect the way the visualization looks.", 
    "So we wanna have time to look at all the expressions here,", 
    "some of them are pretty complex, but let\u2019s at least see a few of them.", 
    "So the first one, total revenue, is basically the basic one.", 
    "It\u2019s the sum of the revenue.", 
    "We saw this before, it\u2019s a simple calculation, but", 
    "all the others are actually based on this measure.", 
    "So the second one I want to show you is this one.", 
    "And this one is the one that is calculated,", 
    "it\u2019s called our sales, and it\u2019s using the calculate function.", 
    "If you remember the calculate function, it first receives", 
    "an expression, and then it receives one or more filters.", 
    "In this case, it filters the data where the Manufacturer column", 
    "from the Manufacturer table have this text, VanArsdel.", 
    "This is the name of our company, the company that runs this analysis.", 
    "So oursales is just the sales for this company.", 
    "Based on, there\u2019s another one here next to it,", 
    "it\u2019s called Sales All Vendors,", 
    "which is using a function we already met before, which is called all.", 
    "And is doing calculate of total revenue for", 
    "all the manufacturers.", 
    "And as you can expect, similar to what we saw before,", 
    "there is a divide function that divides our sales by all sales.", 
    "And this is actually the definition of market shares.", 
    "The sales of our company divided by the sales of", 
    "all the manufacturers together give a percentage.", 
    "And this can be sliced, as we saw, by segment,", 
    "by period of time, by anything we want.", 
    "So it responds to the rest of the filter contents.", 
    "So these were the measures required to calculate the market share.", 
    "Let\u2019s now look at something more complex.", 
    "It will be the last thing that we\u2019re going to look here.", 
    "And this is this function,", 
    "looks a little bit has in the middle a function with a very long name.", 
    "And, but the principle is similar.", 
    "This is the function that calculates sales in", 
    "the year before the period that\u2019s part of the context.", 
    "So, if the context selects the year 2013,", 
    "this function will return the sales in 2012.", 
    "If we select 15, it will show 14 and so on.", 
    "So this is always going to return the sales the year before.", 
    "Now the way that calculate works here is that first of all,", 
    "it uses the total revenue in the same way.", 
    "And then it uses the sameperiodlastyear, and, the sameperiod,", 
    "lastyear, gets,", 
    "as an argument, all the values in the column date from the calendar.", 
    "So, remember the calendar.", 
    "It has a column called date.", 
    "I gave the function all the dates.", 
    "Let\u2019s say if I\u2019m filtering on a year,", 
    "I gave it all the days in this year.", 
    "And in return, this function ", 
    "shifts the dates one year backwards.", 
    "So as a return table, this function gets a table and returns a table.", 
    "And the table is the same days that it got as input but", 
    "only shifted one year back.", 
    "When I give it to the calculate function, the calculate function", 
    "will say okay now I have to calculate the total revenue but", 
    "with a modified context.", 
    "And the modified context is the period, the same days last year.", 
    "Now once I have this, and I can do the same divide the function thing", 
    "like I used before with the divide, saying, total revenue minus last", 
    "year revenue divided by last year revenue, actually showed me", 
    "the growth, negative or positive, between last year and this year.", 
    "So you see that the pattern repeats itself.", 
    "We use calculate to create a denominator, and", 
    "then we can use it to create the final measure that we want to show.", 
    "So these are all the measures that I wanted to go into and show you.", 
    "There are some more.", 
    "And you will be able to look at them.", 
    "And if you have questions,", 
    "you will have the forum that you can ask further questions.", 
    "And I hope this would be a good start for", 
    "you to dive in more depth into DAX.", 
    "This would be the level of DAX that we are going to reach", 
    "In this series.", 
    "And thanks, and see you in the next module."
