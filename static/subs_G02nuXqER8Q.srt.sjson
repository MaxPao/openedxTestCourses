    "Hello, welcome back.", 
    "In this module we\u2019re going to actually", 
    "again it will be in two parts and", 
    "we\u2019re going to dive in more depth into the query technology.", 
    "In this case we\u2019re going to bring data from a database, in this", 
    "case a SQL Server database which has multiple tables that I\u2019m interested", 
    "in, and I want to create a model made of this collection of tables.", 
    "And then also we\u2019re going to, in the second part, mash the data,", 
    "create a mash-up of this data with data coming from text files,", 
    "make them seem like as if they come from the same source.", 
    "So there\u2019s a lot of query technology which we\u2019re going to see in", 
    "this part.", 
    "So again, we are looking at Excel.", 
    "Currently there is really nothing in this Excel.", 
    "There\u2019s no data model, there are no tables, nothing.", 
    "So I\u2019m going again to the data and in there I will start a new query.", 
    "In this case it\u2019s not a file, it\u2019s a database.", 
    "You see the list of databases is pretty long.", 
    "If you browse further down you will see that they\u2019re really a long list,", 
    "an interesting list of data sources available.", 
    "In these other sources, you will see Active Directory,", 
    "you\u2019ll see Exchange, CRM, Facebook, Salesforce.", 
    "But we are going to use something more common,", 
    "which is the SQL Server Database.", 
    "So I\u2019m connected to the database,", 
    "and it first of all asks me what is the name the server.", 
    "The server, this is the name of the server.", 
    "Actually it\u2019s the machine I\u2019m using myself.", 
    "And I\u2019m clicking OK.", 
    "Now the first time I\u2019m using this source, it asks me for", 
    "what kind of credential do I want to use.", 
    "Do I want to use my current credential, which is regular Windows", 
    "authentication, give me a warning about encryption, I click OK.", 
    "And it will now actually present me with this navigation dialogue", 
    "showing me the list of databases.", 
    "This is the database that I\u2019m going to use.", 
    "There\u2019s a checkbox here that allows me to select multiple tables,", 
    "and actually I want to select all the tables.", 
    "Every time I\u2019m in a table, as you can see,", 
    "it shows me a preview of the content of this table in the database.", 
    "In some cases, it could be even be the entire table but", 
    "mostly it\u2019s just a subset of the rows of this database.", 
    "And I\u2019m not ready to use these tables as they are, so", 
    "I\u2019m going to click here the Edit, and", 
    "it will bring me into the same editor window that we saw before.", 
    "It tells me that there is a preview already cached,", 
    "and I can refresh it, and", 
    "then I\u2019m sure that actually I am looking at the up-to-date data.", 
    "On the left side I see the list of tables that I imported, and", 
    "I can switch between each one of them and", 
    "apply some steps to each one of these.", 
    "So what do I want to do?", 
    "I want to go to the sales table, and first of all,", 
    "I see here that I have a zip code and a country.", 
    "In this case the data is just for one country, the USA, but", 
    "if I go to the locations table, the locations table", 
    "have actually information about each one of these zips of this region.", 
    "So again, have here the zip code and a country, but", 
    "I also have the city, the state, the region, so on.", 
    "And if I go here and see the list of countries,", 
    "I see that there\u2019s actually more than one country.", 
    "It actually shows me just the US and France.", 
    "There\u2019s more but actually in the preview.", 
    "That it reads so far, because now I\u2019m looking at the preview", 
    "of the data, not all the data, and so only USA and France.", 
    "So the problem with that is that I would like to create a relationship", 
    "between this sales table and the locations table.", 
    "Only that relation, and I didn\u2019t mention before,", 
    "a relationship can be done only based on one column in each side.", 
    "So I can connect zip to zip, but the problem is that the same zip code", 
    "can actually appear in multiple countries.", 
    "And so it means that the zip code is not unique in the locations table.", 
    "And it could potentially not be unique on the sales, well,", 
    "obviously it\u2019s not unique in the sales table because there\u2019s multiple", 
    "rows for each zip.", 
    "And the relationship has to be unique at least on one side.", 
    "We said that each relation is one to many, so", 
    "on the one side has to be unique.", 
    "So what can I do?", 
    "I can create a combination between Country and Zip.", 
    "I click on it.", 
    "I Ctrl-click on that.", 
    "And now I want to say that I want to add a column.", 
    "Another option to create a column.", 
    "Remember we had calculated columns in the model, but", 
    "this one is a column that is created in the query.", 
    "It says, okay, do you want a separator between them?", 
    "No, I don\u2019t want, I just want the data itself.", 
    "And I will call the result column, I will call it Location.", 
    "And here it is, I see a location coming here.", 
    "I have to do the same on the other side, so that", 
    "eventually I will be able to create the relationship between those two.", 
    "So merge those two the same way.", 
    "Call it Location.", 
    "Here we go.", 
    "Now we have Location here and Location there", 
    "which I will be able eventually to create a relationship from.", 
    "What else do I want to do?", 
    "I have data here from 2008.", 
    "I don\u2019t need all this data, this historic data.", 
    "I only want to start my analysis starting from 2010.", 
    "So I can go here and apply a filter,", 
    "it recognizes as a date, and I say you can apply a date filter.", 
    "And I want to apply a filter that says,", 
    "I just want data where the date is after", 
    "12/31/2010.", 
    "So starting from January of 2011.", 
    "So this would just fill it now.", 
    "Everything I filter here is actually going to", 
    "import just the data that I filter.", 
    "It\u2019s not just a matter of showing me right here, the editor, less or", 
    "more data.", 
    "It\u2019s actually about going and later on,", 
    "when it goes to input an entire dataset,", 
    "it will input only the data which comply with this filter.", 
    "So now I think I\u2019m ready to go.", 
    "The other tables I don\u2019t need to do anything to, so", 
    "I can go back here and I say Close &amp; Load.", 
    "I know that my default is already to put the data into the model, so", 
    "you know that I will actually get multiple tables into the model.", 
    "I click Load and now it starts loading.", 
    "You see that it\u2019s doing some loading in parallel.", 
    "First it has to read them from the database,", 
    "then it needs to put them into the data model.", 
    "Now I see that it\u2019s making progress on the sales table.", 
    "Even the subset of data from 2011 is almost 2 million rows,", 
    "so we\u2019re waiting a little bit to this data to finish.", 
    "Because I import from multiple tables, it will look to see if there", 
    "are relationships that could be recognized from the database.", 
    "In the database we have something called referential integrity,", 
    "relationship between tables, and let\u2019s now see what indeed", 
    "it was recognizing, so I can go to the manage table.", 
    "I can see my multiple tables.", 
    "Manage, okay, here\u2019s the tables.", 
    "I see that the sales table in the bottom here,", 
    "it said it has 1 million and 800-something rows 137 00:08:42,581 --&gt; 00:08:46,270 If I switch to diagram view, you\u2019ll see that the tables,", 
    "some of them are connected and some of them are not.", 
    "The Sales is connected to the Products table.", 
    "The Products table is connected to a little table that has just", 
    "information about the Manufacturers.", 
    "But the Locations table is not automatically connected to", 
    "the Sales table, and this is because ", 
    "the actual relationship exists only between", 
    "the additional custom column that I created.", 
    "Remember, they were called location.", 
    "So now I can actually drag the connection here and", 
    "create the relationship manually.", 
    "Every time you need the relationship and", 
    "the relationship is not recognized automatically,", 
    "you can actually go here and just do this dragging.", 
    "And create the relationship is pretty simple.", 
    "So once I\u2019ve done that, actually my model is ready.", 
    "I can go to the Insert &gt; Pivot Table,", 
    "like we did a few times before.", 
    "I can close this tab for the workbook queries for now.", 
    "And I can start using data coming from this.", 
    "I have the Revenue.", 
    "Again, from Manufacturer, I can see revenue by manufacturer and,", 
    "From the Products I can.", 
    "So I have the data already coming from this table,", 
    "so this will conclude the first part of this module.", 
    "In the next part we\u2019re going to add another table that is actually", 
    "required to do more sophisticated analysis, a calendar table.", 
    "And also we\u2019re going to bring data and", 
    "mash it up with the data that we brought from SQL Server and", 
    "we\u2019re going to analyze all this data together.", 
    "See you on the next part."
