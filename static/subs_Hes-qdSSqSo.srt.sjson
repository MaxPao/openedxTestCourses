    "Hello, this is part two of module two and in the previous", 
    "part we have seen the content of the Excel Data model.", 
    "What\u2019s in it, and that it\u2019s made of tables and relationships.", 
    "If you haven\u2019t watched it yet, I would recommend going back and", 
    "watching it.", 
    "Because everything that we going to do in this part", 
    "is based on what we just started to do in the previous video.", 
    "So, we finished by having a pivot table populated from the data model.", 
    "We\u2019ve seen that the data, the field list that\u2019s here on the right side,", 
    "contained multiple tables and I was able to drag", 
    "things from each one of the tables, and to create my first pivot.", 
    "One more thing I want to show you here, before we dive into the data", 
    "module using the Power Pivot add in, is, I dragged, and by default", 
    "because I dragged something which is numeric, the revenue.", 
    "It created a value of sum of revenue which is the same behavior", 
    "as Excel would do with native pivot table from grid data.", 
    "But there\u2019s, for example, there\u2019s things which are possible here which", 
    "are not possible with a regular native pivot table.", 
    "So, for example, if I drag the customer key to the values area,", 
    "by default it will do something that is not really very useful,", 
    "which is the sum of customer key, but I can go and", 
    "change it to use another aggregation.", 
    "And, if you see the bottom one the very last one of the aggregations", 
    "is very very important.", 
    "This is the Distinct Count.", 
    "Distinct Count, so now, what I see is for", 
    "each combination of country and category of products,", 
    "I see the number of customers that actually have purchased this", 
    "combination,  bikes in a country, unique customers.", 
    "In the same way, I can drag now a product and show you", 
    "how many different products were bought in a combination and so on.", 
    "And this is something that is impossible to really do with", 
    "a regular pivot and in general in many other tools is very,", 
    "very difficult to do.", 
    "And you can see that, with the same speed I can immediately", 
    "calculate these results for any combination of slicers and so on.", 
    "So, after we saw these two,", 
    "let\u2019s go back to the window that we saw on the previous model.", 
    "The window into the data model, the manage, and", 
    "in here continue to do a few more things.", 
    "So, first of all, if you notice", 
    "the revenue that I use was not really formatted nicely.", 
    "I can, for each one of the columns, I can apply a format.", 
    "I can go, for example, and say that this is currency.", 
    "So, from now on every time I use this column,", 
    "it will be formatted appropriately as a currency.", 
    "But what I want to do now, is I want to create something.", 
    "In the previous video, we created two calculated columns.", 
    "Now, the syntax for these columns, maybe you wonder,", 
    "what is the syntax?", 
    "It looks very much like Excel.", 
    "Is it really just an Excel formula?", 
    "Actually, it\u2019s not.", 
    "This expression, which is a very simple one, but", 
    "still, is written in language called DAX, D-A-X.", 
    "And DAX was created together with the data model.", 
    "And it starts by being really very simple but it goes way,", 
    "way beyond that and into some very sophisticated options for", 
    "calculations.", 
    "Now, DAX can be used in Excel in the data model in two", 
    "different positions.", 
    "One is for calculated columns and one is for measures.", 
    "Measures are, there are multiple ways to do them.", 
    "One way is to use this area here below the rows", 
    "in order to create the measures.", 
    "So, let me start creating some simple", 
    "measures and show you, for example.", 
    "If I want to create a measure for the total revenue,", 
    "I will call it totrev.", 
    "And the syntax is name:=.", 
    "And now we start to create an expression.", 
    "Sum of revenue and I complete it with tab.", 
    "Close parentheses.", 
    "And I have the results here, and I can also go and", 
    "format it, let\u2019s say, to be a currency.", 
    "This is my first example of creating a, what is called,", 
    "an explicit measure.", 
    "Actually, I created already measures behind the scenes, if you go for", 
    "a moment back to the pivot.", 
    "When I dragged anything to the values area,", 
    "it actually was creating for me a measure, behind the scenes.", 
    "This is called an implicit measure.", 
    "But, what I just did was to replace this", 
    "implicit functionality by explicitly creating measures.", 
    "So, this one is not more sophisticated than the other that I", 
    "was creating by dragging, but there are reasons even, for", 
    "this kind of simple example, to create explicit measures and", 
    "it\u2019s a good practice to use them exclusively.", 
    "Now, I can also create another one.", 
    "For example, for the total cost.", 
    "And I will say totcost, sum of,", 
    "and this is sum of the cost column in.", 
    "And again, format it as currency.", 
    "Now I will create a third measure", 
    "which is a little bit more sophisticated.", 
    "And this one will be calculating the margin percent.", 
    "So once I have the revenue and", 
    "the cost, I can calculate the margin percent.", 
    "So margin percent:=, and", 
    "here I will say open parenthesis", 
    "revenue minus cost divided by cost.", 
    "So I\u2019m not referring to columns in the table, but instead", 
    "I\u2019m referring to other calculated measures that are already created.", 
    "I will format this as a percent.", 
    "And going back to my pivot,", 
    "I will take out the two.", 
    "I still haven\u2019t replaced it, so for", 
    "now I can leave it or I can take it out.", 
    "But, I want just to show you that now, when I go back to the list", 
    "of columns in this table, the main table, I see the totrev.", 
    "I can click on it, the totcost and the margin which is a percent.", 
    "And, I can still, of course, filter, slice it by year and", 
    "calculate it every time.", 
    "Now let\u2019s stop here for a moment, and actually understand what has", 
    "happened when I created this measure.", 
    "I created this measure once in here.", 
    "And I just said that this is the sum of, so this is like the margin,", 
    "but this is one this is the sum of the column revenue.", 
    "Although I defined it once,", 
    "every time I see its use it gives me a different number.", 
    "And the reason it\u2019s giving me a different number is", 
    "that it\u2019s being calculated fresh every time with a different context.", 
    "And the context, like in this cell here is Australia bikes in 2006.", 
    "So, this is the sum of revenue and this is the sum of cost.", 
    "And this is the margin for", 
    "this combination of Australia, bikes and the year 2006.", 
    "If I go here, this would be another calculation.", 
    "Again, every time it\u2019s another calculation.", 
    "If I go to the grand total, again it\u2019s a calculation of this measure.", 
    "It\u2019s not a sum of this column here,", 
    "it\u2019s actually a new fresh calculation with a new context.", 
    "So, this is a very,", 
    "very important principle for the DAX language that we\u2019re going to see,", 
    "and I will repeat a few times for you to grasp the importance of,", 
    "that every measure is calculated with a context.", 
    "And the context, by default, comes from if it\u2019s used in the pivot,", 
    "there\u2019s something on columns, something on rows, some slicers,", 
    "a filter maybe for the pivot and so on.", 
    "So all this gives a context in which the calculation is calculated.", 
    "So this is for measures.", 
    "Now, what about, let\u2019s switch back for", 
    "a moment to understand more about the calculated columns.", 
    "Do they also have the same filter context?", 
    "Well, actually they don\u2019t.", 
    "They have a different context.", 
    "When I calculate this calculated column, it doesn\u2019t", 
    "see the pivot that will eventually be used or built from that.", 
    "It actually sees the row that it lives in.", 
    "And you can use any other column in this row of data.", 
    "So, in this case, it\u2019s used the other quantity and the list price.", 
    "It could also use columns in other tables, like an extended row.", 
    "And why is that?", 
    "It is because of the relationships.", 
    "The relationships make other columns to be kind of related to this one.", 
    "So for example, for each row here, I have the product key.", 
    "So every property of the product,", 
    "I can use here, or I have the customer key.", 
    "So, because of the relationship with customers,", 
    "I can use data from the customers in here if I need to.", 
    "Let me give you one example to create such a calculated column that", 
    "is using the context which is called the row context to,", 
    "let\u2019s go, and for example into the product table.", 
    "And in the product table I have this data and I want,", 
    "let\u2019s say that you saw that I have product category table and", 
    "product sub category table.", 
    "But those two tables are actually used just for one column each.", 
    "The dimproductcategory has the category name and", 
    "the subcategory has the subcategory name.", 
    "I may have a goal to reduce the number of tables that my user sees", 
    "when he creates a pivot table.", 
    "In order to do that, I can actually create a column here,", 
    "in the products table that will have the category name, for example.", 
    "So, in order to do that I create a new column.", 
    "And I use a DAX function called related.", 
    "Related means I\u2019m going to use a column from another table but", 
    "that is related to this one.", 
    "And, immediately it gives me the list of options of things which", 
    "are related to where I am.", 
    "And the first one is what I want.", 
    "I want a category name.", 
    "So give me the category name for this product.", 
    "So it goes, and it brings the necessary data from the other.", 
    "Now it seems as if it didn\u2019t bring anything, but actually it did,", 
    "because there are some products in the beginning that did not", 
    "have the right connection to subcategories and so on.", 
    "So, it seems empty but it\u2019s not.", 
    "And I can call it category.", 
    "So now I have a category column in the product table.", 
    "And this will also enable me, so I have here, see the list of bikes,", 
    "clothing, components, and some products which will actually", 
    "have a blank for the name of the category.", 
    "So, once I have this,", 
    "I can actually say that I don\u2019t need the product category.", 
    "I can go here, right-click and say just hide it.", 
    "I don\u2019t delete it, but I hide it.", 
    "So, when I go back to my pivot table,", 
    "I will see that the product category table have disappeared.", 
    "And if I opened a dimproduct table, I will see that it has now", 
    "a new column that wasn\u2019t there that is called a category.", 
    "And I can use this instead of the original one that came from", 
    "the category table.", 
    "So I reduce the number of tables and", 
    "I added a calculated column from a related table.", 
    "So this ends the second part of this module.", 
    "We\u2019ve seen the data model.", 
    "We\u2019ve seen relationships.", 
    "We\u2019ve started to see calculated measures using DAX.", 
    "And we saw the use of calculated columns.", 
    "The measures are calculated within a filter context,", 
    "while the calculated columns are calculated within a row context.", 
    "We\u2019re going to use a lot more of the measures, not so", 
    "much calculated columns, in subsequent modules.", 
    "I hope to see you there."
