    "Welcome back.", 
    "This is module number five in our series about data analysis and", 
    "visualization in Excel.", 
    "We\u2019ll do this in two parts.", 
    "And the entire module is about the DAX language.", 
    "We already started in previous modules to see some of the basics of", 
    "the DAX language, but we go deeper in this one.", 
    "And I just want to tell you upfront that even the depth that we", 
    "are going to cover in this one is not going to be enough for", 
    "you to do real work unless you check other sources that we will provide.", 
    "And maybe also we will record other modules specifically about", 
    "the DAX language.", 
    "But for now let\u2019s start to see,", 
    "I\u2019m going to use the same model that I used in the previous module, and", 
    "I am going to start by going right there into the manage window.", 
    "Remember we have this sales table that doesn\u2019t have the revenue or", 
    "the cost calculated.", 
    "So, I am going to again calculate it as a calculated column the revenue.", 
    "So, I\u2019m going to do equals quantity times list price.", 
    "And rename this column to be revenue.", 
    "Once I have such a column,", 
    "remember this is a calculated column it uses a context we call", 
    "the row context so it can use all the other columns in the same row.", 
    "And it can also use other columns in other tables provided that there\u2019s", 
    "a relationship between this table on the many side and", 
    "the other table on the one side.", 
    "So, this is calculated columns.", 
    "Based on regular columns or", 
    "calculated columns, I can create measures.", 
    "Measures, I can do it from here, or I can do it, and", 
    "I\u2019ll show you later, directly from the pivot table.", 
    "So, once I have revenue, let\u2019s say, I can create tote revenue column", 
    "equals sum of revenue close parenthesis so", 
    "now I have myself a measure that I would be able to use in the pivot.", 
    "But I want to show you an alternative way to calculate", 
    "actually the same number.", 
    "And this is a way that will actually not even require me to", 
    "add this calculated column to do the multiplication for", 
    "Each row, because what we do here is,", 
    "for each row I multiply the order quantity with the list price.", 
    "But I can actually have a function,", 
    "a measure that will do this multiply for each row", 
    "in just one shot without requiring a special calculated column.", 
    "So let\u2019s do TotRevenue take 2 as a measure, column, equal, and", 
    "now I will use instead of the sum function,", 
    "the sum function is a simple function that\u2019s very similar to", 
    "the sum function Excel, just takes all the values and sums them.", 
    "But now I\u2019m going to use the sumx function.", 
    "The sumx function is part of a family of functions in DAX that", 
    "together with the averagex, countx, meanx, maxx, and so on,", 
    "that their nature is that they expect", 
    "a table as their first argument and once they get a table they start", 
    "iterating on the rows of this table and for each table applying,", 
    "an expression that is going to be the second argument, and", 
    "then applying something to the totals of all these expressions.", 
    "In this case sumx would just summarize the results of these", 
    "expressions.", 
    "Countx will count the results that are not null,", 
    "averageX will average them and so on.", 
    "So this is sumx, on the Internet sales table.", 
    "And the second argument is, as I said, is an expression.", 
    "And this expression is very similar to the one in which we just did on", 
    "in the calculated column.", 
    "Because it actually goes in each row and", 
    "calculates exactly the same thing.", 
    "The quantity times.", 
    "The price list.", 
    "Or list price, as they called it.", 
    "Okay.", 
    "I click enter now.", 
    "And I will format it.", 
    "And right here, you can see that these two", 
    "are actually returning the same value.", 
    "If I\u2019m going back to Excel, and", 
    "then create myself a pivot, and use both of them.", 
    "You will see that there is actually no need to use both because they", 
    "are exactly the same.", 
    "Only one is using a calculated column and", 
    "summarizing the results of the calculated column.", 
    "While the other is", 
    "doing this multiplication while it\u2019s being calculated as a measure.", 
    "So if I add to it any,", 
    "let\u2019s say country you see that this really just repeats itself.", 
    "The total revenue, I misspelled total revenue,", 
    "doesn\u2019t matter.", 
    "It is exactly as the second one,", 
    "only calculated in two different ways.", 
    "All right that\u2019s one example of using slightly more complex,", 
    "DAX expression.", 
    "Let\u2019s do the other measures right there from the Pivot.", 
    "So once I am in the field list of the pivot table,", 
    "first of all, I can see the measures right here with a special icon", 
    "designating them as measures.", 
    "This is new for Excel 2016.", 
    "You will not see this icon in 2013 and also you will", 
    "not be able to do what you can do here which is right click and", 
    "edit or delete the measure.", 
    "So manipulating the measure from the filters is new for", 
    "Excel 2016.", 
    "So what I can do is also, from here, from the table, I can add a measure.", 
    "So let\u2019s add a measure that is", 
    "going to be RevenueAllCountries.", 
    "The RevenueAllCountries.", 
    "Its purpose is to give me the total for", 
    "all countries regardless of the context.", 
    "So if I use it for Australia it will give me all countries.", 
    "If I use it for Canada it will give me all countries.", 
    "Why do I need it?", 
    "You\u2019ll see in a moment.", 
    "I will not use it directly in the pivot but", 
    "I would actually use it in some further calculations.", 
    "So in order to do that I will use I will introduce for", 
    "the first time a function which is maybe", 
    "the mother of all functions in DAX called calculate.", 
    "It\u2019s very useful.", 
    "It can start very easing gradual, but", 
    "it can actually become in some advanced usages it\u2019s not an easy", 
    "to master so we\u2019ll recommend really to start using it gradually and", 
    "then learn more about it from the resources we\u2019re going to provide.", 
    "So the calculate as you can see expect two parameters,", 
    "the first is an expression.", 
    "So an expression, I can give it an expression", 
    "that I already calculated, the total revenue.", 
    "Either one, it doesn\u2019t matter which one of the two.", 
    "I have two options to actually calculate the same, as we saw.", 
    "Now, from this position on, it accepts a series of filters and", 
    "this filters can apply changes to the context.", 
    "So, as I said in this example,", 
    "I want to actually calculate the sales for all countries, regardless", 
    "of which country is currently being filtered by the context.", 
    "So the way to do that is to create all.", 
    "Use the function that\u2019s called all.", 
    "We\u2019ll just say, forget about what\u2019s in the context, for", 
    "this specific column of country.", 
    "So, calculate total revenue based on all countries.", 
    "I can check this formula for syntax and it\u2019s okay.", 
    "I can also give it a format from here: currency with two decimals.", 
    "And now I have the new one.", 
    "Now I will add it to the pivot, just to understand it.", 
    "Not because really it\u2019s very useful to use in the pivot.", 
    "Because it\u2019s purpose is to not be used directly in the pivot, but", 
    "rather to be used in another calculation that will", 
    "come in a moment.", 
    "But let\u2019s save it for now.", 
    "When I add it to the pivot, and", 
    "let\u2019s just take one of the two identical ones", 
    "out because they don\u2019t add anything.", 
    "So when I add it to the pivot you see is that it doesn\u2019t matter what is", 
    "in the row for country.", 
    "This measure always returns the total for all countries.", 
    "Now it does respond to other filters.", 
    "It\u2019s not that it\u2019s oblivious to any filter.", 
    "So if I for example put the year.", 
    "Like this.", 
    "You see that the revenue for", 
    "all countries is showing a different value for each year.", 
    "So, it does respond to other filters.", 
    "It just is actually does not respond to the change between Australia,", 
    "Canada, and so on, between the countries.", 
    "It always returns the total of all countries.", 
    "Let\u2019s take it out from the pivot,", 
    "because as I said, we will need it for another calculation.", 
    "And not directly.", 
    "So, from here, I will go and add another measure.", 
    "And this one is going to be called,", 
    "percent from all countries.", 
    "And here I will say that I want to use the total revenue.", 
    "The total revenue, this one right here.", 
    "Divided by the one that we just calculated.", 
    "It\u2019s called revenue for all country.", 
    "So we do one divided by the other.", 
    "Actually, instead of using the operator for", 
    "divide it\u2019s better to use a function in DAX called divide.", 
    "The reason it is better, because this is a safe divide.", 
    "If the denominator is zero, it will return blank and", 
    "not give us any weird results.", 
    "So, I can check the formula.", 
    "It\u2019s okay. And now, if I add this one to", 
    "the I", 
    "forgot to actually format it.", 
    "So let\u2019s say that this is a number and it\u2019s actually a percent.", 
    "And have two digits, all right.", 
    "So now we see for each country, how the percent for", 
    "this country is from the total.", 
    "We divided the actual revenue, which is calculated by the context", 
    "which include the country with a measure that ignores the country.", 
    "So it actually, for the grand total, it gives us 100% and", 
    "it\u2019s true that you can actually do something like that in the context", 
    "of the pivot to show as the percent from the total but", 
    "by doing this with  DAX formulas, we can get far beyond", 
    "what we can do actually by using just the features of the pivot.", 
    "And you will see later on examples in which the calculate function will", 
    "become more and more complex and do more and more sophisticated stuff.", 
    "So, in this part we actually covered the beginning of the calculate", 
    "function, we saw the use of the sumx function, as a representative for", 
    "the family of the x functions, with, together with and", 
    "so on and we started to feel the power of the DAX language,", 
    "more in the second part."
