    "Remember in the previous part, I imported data from SQL server,", 
    "bringing in four tables,", 
    "making sure that they have relationship between them.", 
    "Some of the relationships were identified automatically,", 
    "detected by the tool.", 
    "One of them I needed to do manually.", 
    "And in this part I will add some aspects to this model,", 
    "bringing some additional data, combining it with existing data, and", 
    "making it a more complete model.", 
    "So let me just first jump into the window, the manage window,", 
    "and one of the things that in almost every model we do we need,", 
    "is a calendar table.", 
    "Calendar tables are required ", 
    "we have a date In the cell\u2019s table we do have a date column, but", 
    "this is just a date.", 
    "What if I want to filter on year, months, week or so on.", 
    "And also, what if I want to do some more sophisticated calculations,", 
    "that I will actually show you in a later module,", 
    "like year over year comparisons.", 
    "For all these purposes, we do need a calendar table.", 
    "Now in Excel 2016, we actually added a very easy way to do this.", 
    "With previous versions you will need to either create the table in Excel", 
    "and bring data in Excel.", 
    "By the way, I didn\u2019t mention but", 
    "you can actually create tables in Excel and bring them into the model.", 
    "So one of the sources available to you is just a table in Excel.", 
    "But here, you see that I go to the design tab", 
    "in the window of the manage window.", 
    "And I see that there is a data table here, and", 
    "I can say create me a new data table.", 
    "So this is just one click, and", 
    "it added the table to my model, called calendar.", 
    "It has one column of type date, and additional columns,", 
    "calculated columns, that add all kind of properties to it.", 
    "The only thing I still need to do is to create", 
    "a relationship between this new table and the rest of the tables.", 
    "Oh actually, because I had to redo it, I didn\u2019t do the, so", 
    "let me very quickly do the relationship between", 
    "locations and the locations here so,", 
    "cuz this is, we need it for the rest of it, so.", 
    "And, the new table, which is just hiding here because of the scale.", 
    "Let me bring it back.", 
    "And, now I can just create a relationship between the date here", 
    "and the date in sales.", 
    "It created everything I needed, only it didn\u2019t create the relationship.", 
    "It actually created the necessary data in the data,", 
    "in the calendar table for", 
    "all the dates it found in any one of the tables.", 
    "It analyzes all the tables, found, in this case there is", 
    "only one date column and it goes from 2011 to 2015.", 
    "I have data in the calendar table for all these years.", 
    "If I want to I can go to the data table and actually, I can extend it.", 
    "Once I am on it I can extend the dates and make dates for the years.", 
    "But let\u2019s go because we have work to do.", 
    "Let\u2019s go back to Excel and I want to create another query.", 
    "This query is actually, the reason that I need to do another query is", 
    "that this company has the sales data for", 
    "the US in this SQL server database but sales data from other countries", 
    "are sent as text files to this guy who\u2019s doing this analysis.", 
    "And I am this guy in this case, and", 
    "I need to combine the data from the text files to", 
    "the data from the SQL server to be able to create some global analysis.", 
    "So, how do I do that?", 
    "I go to another query from file.", 
    "And here, It\u2019s not a single CSV, but", 
    "actually it\u2019s a folder full of CSV data.", 
    "Here is this folder.", 
    "You see that there are a bunch of, in this case four, files.", 
    "I copy the path.", 
    "I paste it here.", 
    "And now I will create a query from the entire content of this query.", 
    "I have all kinds of columns of properties of the file,", 
    "which I\u2019m not interested in at this point", 
    "I\u2019m just interested in the first column, which is the content.", 
    "I can click on this icon here and", 
    "get myself into the Editor with all the data in", 
    "all these files combined together, as if they were one.", 
    "The headers from the first file were used to become the headers for", 
    "the entire file, which is fine for me, but", 
    "there are a few cleanup things that I need to do.", 
    "First of all, I need to create what is", 
    "called the custom column here in the query.", 
    "Remember from country and zip I need to do it also here.", 
    "Because this will be actually the extension", 
    "of the sales table which already have this column.", 
    "So merge column,", 
    "the same way we did before and it\u2019s going to be again the location.", 
    "Here it\u2019s very important to give it the same name.", 
    "Because this is how, when we append this data to the previous data,", 
    "each column here would find its matching in the existing data.", 
    "That\u2019s fine.", 
    "Now, there\u2019s another little problem here, which is that each one of", 
    "the files, and remember there were four of them, has as its first row", 
    "the headers and I need to get rid of all the other headers except the one", 
    "that was used for giving the headers for the entire file.", 
    "Now I cannot filter it from here.", 
    "I can actually go from here, so for example I can say,", 
    "in the zip column, it\u2019s a text field and I can say I want", 
    "to filter out all the rows which does not equal the word zip.", 
    "But I would like to do it before, no actually now it\u2019s,", 
    "I didn\u2019t filter the date yet so it\u2019s actually a good time.", 
    "I can say does not equal.", 
    "So the zip column does not equal the value zip itself", 
    "assuming there is no zip code called zip.", 
    "And I\u2019m filtering it out so by filtering the value of zip I", 
    "actually filter the rows which were including the headers for", 
    "the other files.", 
    "Now that I got rid of those, I can actually go to the date field and", 
    "apply the filter on the date field to include only years after 2011.", 
    "Remember, I did the same for the sales and", 
    "there\u2019s no point in bringing me the international data from 1999 when", 
    "I\u2019m actually interested in 2011.", 
    "All right so now we have these four files and", 
    "I\u2019m going to the close and load to dialogue, because I actually", 
    "don\u2019t want this query to be loaded to the data module as yet.", 
    "I just want to define it, create it,", 
    "and it will be ready for the next step.", 
    "So I am going to load it, but not really load it.", 
    "It\u2019s just a connection.", 
    "It\u2019s not loaded to the data model, and also not loaded into Excel.", 
    "So, here it is Query1, it says connection only.", 
    "Now I go back to the sales table.", 
    "And go again into the Editor.", 
    "And I am going to add another step to this.", 
    "This is the table.", 
    "By the way, I want to draw your attention to these two columns,", 
    "location and products here.", 
    "Those are very special columns that were added by the query,", 
    "because it detected the relationship between this table and others.", 
    "There\u2019s actually an option that I will not use here to select", 
    "columns for these other tables, and add them automatically to here.", 
    "So, you can just ignore them, and", 
    "they will not do anything in the model, if you don\u2019t use them.", 
    "So, I will use another step, which is called the append query.", 
    "I will append another query to this query, so", 
    "the query to append will be the one called Query1.", 
    "I just left it as a default name.", 
    "I didn\u2019t bother to change the name to something else,", 
    "because I knew that this would not become a table in the database,", 
    "even in the model eventually, so", 
    "I didn\u2019t care much about giving it a meaningful name, and I click OK.", 
    "So now we have another step.", 
    "I want to also draw your attention to another element and", 
    "this is the fact that here, I have some", 
    "expressions that, this is actually the actual", 
    "script line that is doing, in this case, the append query.", 
    "Each step here will have its corresponding line in the script.", 
    "And this script is,", 
    "we don\u2019t really are going to look at this at this point.", 
    "We\u2019re not interested in the actual syntax.", 
    "In more advanced use of the queries you can actually start", 
    "getting more to know the language this script is written on.", 
    "The language is called the M language, but for now,", 
    "in our course here, we\u2019re not going to touch it for anything.", 
    "So, but it\u2019s there, and actually if you know what you\u2019re doing you can", 
    "go and actually apply some tweaks to the syntax.", 
    "But for now we are happy with that, and we are going to close and", 
    "load, and now what will happen is that", 
    "the sales query will fire again, repeat everything, all the steps,", 
    "which starts by reading this two million rows from a SQL server.", 
    "Once it\u2019s done reading the two million rows form SQL server,", 
    "it will start reading the rows from the Query1.", 
    "Which is in itself four CSV files combined together.", 
    "And the end result of the sales table is going to be", 
    "the entire content of the sales table.", 
    "Starting filtering to only 2011,", 
    "plus the text files appended to it and all", 
    "of them will become one big happy file, happy table in the model.", 
    "And then subsequently if I get these", 
    "text files every month, I can just repeat this entire process and", 
    "it will give me the entire global analysis.", 
    "But what happened here?", 
    "We got some yellow notification here, and", 
    "the model looks very funny.", 
    "It shows me the same value for every cell.", 
    "What happened?", 
    "Actually, because now the sales table is not directly a table from", 
    "the database, the tool recognized that the previously identified,", 
    "detected relationship between this sales stable and", 
    "the other tables are not valid anymore.", 
    "And so it decided to delete it.", 
    "This is a functionality that we probably are going to change in", 
    "the future.", 
    "But it\u2019s actually very easy to fix because we have another, new for", 
    "2016, functionality to detect the relationships from the data.", 
    "So now when I clicked on it, it actually brought back the numbers", 
    "to where they were and we now have the data from all countries.", 
    "And if I go to the location and pick the country and", 
    "make it into a slicer, I see all the countries from which I have data,", 
    "and I can see the data from France and I can control click and", 
    "see the data from France and Germany and so on.", 
    "So now we have a truly global analysis of the data for", 
    "this company.", 
    "So to conclude, we added a calendar table using", 
    "a functionality that was added to Power Pivot or to Excel,", 
    "Power Pivot in Excel in this version of 2016.", 
    "We also created another query from a folder of text files, added", 
    "all the contents of these text files to the sales table, and eventually", 
    "we got a model that has data both from SQL and from the text files.", 
    "And it\u2019s now a global file.", 
    "Thank you, and see you in the next module."
