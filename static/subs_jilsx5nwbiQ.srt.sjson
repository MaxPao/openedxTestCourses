    "Welcome back.", 
    "This is Module 8, and in this module I will introduce a totally", 
    "new environment which is called Power BI.", 
    "Power BI is a service that we provide as Microsoft.", 
    "It\u2019s a cloud based service that can", 
    "provide the organization with a place to store dashboards and", 
    "reports, all kinds of visualizations.", 
    "And the reason I\u2019m going to show it is that it\u2019s actually very relevant", 
    "to an Excel user because you can actually create the contents.", 
    "One of the options to create the contents will be using Excel.", 
    "And even if you use one of the other options to create the content,", 
    "everything you have learned so far in this series", 
    "of modules will be relevant and will help you building this content", 
    "even if you are not using Excel because the same data model.", 
    "The same technology for queries, the same DAX expressions,", 
    "are actually the way you build the content for", 
    "this service, which is Power BI.", 
    "Power BI comes as a freemium.", 
    "So there\u2019s a free model.", 
    "You can start using it right away.", 
    "In a few seconds, you can just sign up with your company email.", 
    "Get an account and start uploading content and", 
    "connecting to a variety of data sources.", 
    "But there is, you can go and pay for", 
    "a paying subscription and then you get additional capabilities.", 
    "More storage to store your models and so on.", 
    "Now, just before I show you anything I want to say that", 
    "I\u2019m going to show just a very narrow aspect of the capabilities of", 
    "this service, because I\u2019m actually showing the Excel part in it, and", 
    "how to use Excel to upload into the server, or the service.", 
    "But this is not the only way, there are other ways to do that.", 
    "And there is a lot of other functionality that you should learn,", 
    "if you want to learn more about the service, and we will point you to training,", 
    "specific training just about Power BI.", 
    "So I am here in the browser, have nothing in the browser.", 
    "So, and I\u2019m writing msit.powerbi.com", 
    "MS IT is Microsoft IT so I\u2019m getting into our tenant in Power BI.", 
    "And right away I\u2019m presented with a dashboard.", 
    "That is actually showing data coming from which should be familiar", 
    "because it\u2019s actually using the same model that I created with Excel.", 
    "So what I did.", 
    "I uploaded to this service the Excel in a way that actually the service", 
    "is now using the data model with its connection, with its expressions,", 
    "DAX expressions, everything I did but not the visualization.", 
    "It just, and the way I uploaded it right now,", 
    "I am just using it as the data model.", 
    "And, on top of that, I was able to build two entities.", 
    "One is dashboards.", 
    "And this is a dashboard,", 
    "it\u2019s made of those elements which are called tiles.", 
    "And, you can see, right away, that the variety of visualizations is", 
    "beyond what you can do with Excel for example showing", 
    "data on a map or using this tree map where it shows the area for", 
    "each one of the manufacturers which represent their relative size", 
    "in sales and so on.", 
    "So this is the dashboard.", 
    "And once I click.", 
    "Now, the dashboard can contain tiles coming from", 
    "different reports connected to different data sets.", 
    "It can have under the list of data sets  61 00:04:03,941 --&gt; 00:04:07,700 it\u2019s really a large one if I want to add a new data set.", 
    "Just to show you lists of things that you can draw data from.", 
    "It\u2019s a very, very long list.", 
    "So, I\u2019m not going to go into any of that.", 
    "Actually the source I was using is a model in Excel, but", 
    "if you want to you can add, and if you go back to my area and", 
    "to the dashboard, so, I was saying that the dashboard can contain tiles", 
    "coming from and connecting to any one of these sources.", 
    "Once I click on a tile, by default,", 
    "it takes me to the report from which this tile was coming from.", 
    "In the report, again, here I\u2019m just browsing it but", 
    "in a moment I will be able to, I will show you how can I edit it.", 
    "Now for example here I have a slicer that I can", 
    "select a different year and", 
    "all those other elements respond to the slicer.", 
    "Another element here or another capability is to click on one chart", 
    "and by clicking one chart, I see the effect of this chart on the others.", 
    "So, any chart can be used as a slicer, against all the others.", 
    "This is called cross-highlighting.", 
    "If I want to, I can go into, because I am the owner of that,", 
    "I can go to an editing experience, and start editing this", 
    "report and you can see here the list on the right side,", 
    "the variety of the different visualization types,", 
    "including this kind of map in which each element is a circle.", 
    "Representing the size of one of the measures, but there is also another.", 
    "So I can go here and change its visualization to something else, for", 
    "example, to this kind of map,", 
    "in which the area is actually colored and the intensity of", 
    "the color represents again the measure that I want to visualize.", 
    "And I can switch this to just a table with the numbers, and", 
    "so on to any one of the other visualizations.", 
    "So now you can see even maybe with more ease when I click on the USA,", 
    "you can see how USA affects all of the other charts.", 
    "This is a very important property of this environment,", 
    "which is based on a technology called power view.", 
    "So, this is the chart, the report.", 
    "From the report, I could now,", 
    "all this actually elements here are already part of the dashboard.", 
    "But just to show you when I\u2019m looking at one of", 
    "these elements in the report I can pin it and", 
    "it will go and pin to the dashboard which is the current dashboard.", 
    "So if I switch back to the dashboard.", 
    "Okay, it asks me if I want to save the changes that I did and", 
    "I said yes.", 
    "But now I will see this new element added to the dashboard.", 
    "So every time, now in the dashboard I can edit some properties of it,", 
    "I can give it a title and,", 
    "but now this becomes part of the dashboard, and again,", 
    "if I click on it, it will go back to the report that it came from.", 
    "Now I\u2019m using this from the dashboard, sorry, from the browser.", 
    "We\u2019ll see in the next part of this module we\u2019ll see that", 
    "this is not the only option to use.", 
    "It\u2019s not just a browser based tool.", 
    "Now in order to create the content,", 
    "as I said this content I created with the Excel but", 
    "there\u2019s also a companion application called Power PI Desktop that you can", 
    "use it instead of Excel to create the content, to import the data", 
    "using queries to create the DAX expressions, calculate columns,", 
    "calculate measures, you can do it with Power PI desktop.", 
    "And there are advantages to do that in this way.", 
    "There are also advantages of doing this in Excel.", 
    "Now, I want show you a new capability of this that was,", 
    "the capability that was added recently before this went", 
    "into general availability not long ago.", 
    "And this is about Excel.", 
    "It\u2019s again, relevant to Excel.", 
    "I\u2019m going to the Get Data, and", 
    "I\u2019m saying that I want to bring data from a file.", 
    "And the file is residing on One Drive for Business.", 
    "So it\u2019s now connecting to, it knows I am authenticated.", 
    "It knows where my files are, and I have a folder here called For", 
    "Excel Training, in which I\u2019ve stored some material, and", 
    "it\u2019s actually a version of the same file, but I designate it as", 
    "to be used as Excel, and we\u2019ll see in a moment what it does.", 
    "First, let it start uploading it to the service.", 
    "So, once I decided I want to use this one,", 
    "it actually tells me, asks me one of two options.", 
    "What do I want to do?", 
    "Do I want to import the Excel data into the Power BI service, and", 
    "this is what I did before.", 
    "To import means, use the model in this Excel, and", 
    "then start to build reports and dashboards on top or", 
    "I just want to connect to it as it sits in OneDrive for", 
    "business and here I\u2019m selecting the option to", 
    "actually connect and it\u2019s started to do that.", 
    "It\u2019s been added as a report, but", 
    "the behavior of clicking on this report is completely different.", 
    "When I click on it, it opens this dialogue.", 
    "It asks me, what do you want to do with it and", 
    "you can see that there are options for example to schedule a refresh so", 
    "I can actually schedule a refresh that will run everyday", 
    "at a specific hour and actually pull data from the data sources and so", 
    "on but what I want to do with it now is viewing it.", 
    "Now what it does it opens the Excel file and", 
    "I will be interacting with it in the similar way that", 
    "I was interacting with it when I was in Excel.", 
    "So now this should look familiar to you,", 
    "we have been looking at this report in previous modules.", 
    "And you can see that I can switch between the different ones.", 
    "I can click on the slicers,", 
    "if you remember I have the two ways to see it.", 
    "I can go back here.", 
    "Select another year.", 
    "So all the slicers, all the functionalities available to me,", 
    "only that now I am actually opening this Excel from the browser,", 
    "and using the technology that we\u2019ve had for", 
    "quite some time called Excel Services or Excel Online.", 
    "And it\u2019s only that", 
    "it\u2019s now integrated into the experience of Power BI.", 
    "So again, I can upload Excel files in two different ways,", 
    "one is to be used as the model,", 
    "and to build dashboards and reports from it.", 
    "And one is to actually upload it as a report with", 
    "the visualizations of Excel.", 
    "Here it\u2019s pivot chart.", 
    "It could be also a pivot with all its functionality and", 
    "all its capabilities to do a really very advanced analytics.", 
    "It\u2019s all available for you in this way in the browser.", 
    "So you can choose between the two.", 
    "Once you are in the Excel client by the way.", 
    "In the Excel client if I switch back there is a publish option that", 
    "can actually push it directly from Excel to the Power BI environment.", 
    "So, to summarize, I\u2019ve shown you, oh, I need to show you", 
    "one more thing in the Power BI, because it\u2019s really the highlight of", 
    "what we can do with this model once it\u2019s there.", 
    "It\u2019s something called, you see here,", 
    "there is an area, it says ask the questions about the data.", 
    "So if I start saying our share which is a.", 
    "Am I in the right?", 
    "Yeah.", 
    "Our share and by year.", 
    "And country.", 
    "So I can start writing this English statement and", 
    "it will create visualizations for me on the fly.", 
    "Knowing the metadata.", 
    "The names for the measures.", 
    "The names for and for the different dimensions,", 
    "different fields and it\u2019s a very powerful way for business users", 
    "to start asking their questions and getting things beyond what was", 
    "presented to them by the author of the dashboard or the report.", 
    "And this is something that you can play with,", 
    "you can just open an account right away,", 
    "get some of the sample dashboards without even uploading anything.", 
    "And start playing with these technologies and see for", 
    "yourselves how powerful this is in creating visualizations on the fly.", 
    "Okay, we have just one more to go, which we\u2019ll keep as a surprise for", 
    "the next module.", 
    "See you there."
