    "Hello and welcome back.", 
    "We are at module seven and in this module we will use", 
    "the same model that I used in the previous examples.", 
    "But this time we will concentrate on doing the actual visualizations,", 
    "adding pivot charts, adding slicers, connecting both.", 
    "Go a little more into cube functions which I mentioned but", 
    "I didn\u2019t show you the details.", 
    "We were using them so going to use those also.", 
    "So, using the actual model for creating the visualization.", 
    "So, we are starting with Excel.", 
    "We have one of the examples I had before, but", 
    "actually I\u2019m not going to touch it.", 
    "I\u2019m going to open a new worksheet here and start adding stuff to it and", 
    "building on the model which is already here.", 
    "So first I would like to build some kind of a dashboard.", 
    "So, that will probably be built off Pivot Charts.", 
    "Now a pivot charts can be standalone, this is not new for 2016", 
    "but it was added  in the previous version of Excel, the fact that you", 
    "can add a pivot chart without adding the pivot table first.", 
    "So I can use Insert Pivot Chart, the default,", 
    "again, is to use the workbook Data Model.", 
    "So I\u2019m happy with the default and I click OK.", 
    "So I got this chart, it\u2019s pretty big.", 
    "So maybe because I want to show a few of them, I\u2019ll make it smaller.", 
    "One good thing is actually, before we continue,", 
    "it\u2019s always a good idea in creating these kind of visualizations, to", 
    "turn off a few Excel features like grid lines, the most important one.", 
    "We really don\u2019t need the grid lines as we\u2019re not doing any, or", 
    "almost any Excel references and so on.", 
    "So, here\u2019s the Pivot Chart and the Pivot Chart has the field list.", 
    "Now I cleaned the field list by hiding some tables,", 
    "and for example, you don\u2019t see here the main sales table.", 
    "Actually you see it only as the measures in it, and", 
    "it shows as sales with a sigma in front.", 
    "So what I did is I\u2019ve hidden all the columns and", 
    "I\u2019m left only with the measures.", 
    "So, this is the way it actually looks and it\u2019s much easier to work.", 
    "And when I\u2019m giving this to a person to build their own visualizations,", 
    "I\u2019m trying to minimize the amount of things that they will see.", 
    "if they don\u2019t need all the tables, I will hide some of the tables.", 
    "If they don\u2019t need columns, I will hide those and so on.", 
    "So, I can start selecting.", 
    "Let\u2019s say I want to see our sales and I want to see them by segment.", 
    "So, here it is, most of our sales are just in a few segments.", 
    "And let\u2019s build another one, another Pivot Chart.", 
    "I have to go out of the existing one.", 
    " here, Insert /", 
    "Pivot Chart once again, OK.", 
    "Again, make it a little smaller and put it somewhere here,", 
    "maybe making it the same size.", 
    "And maybe now I want to see something else.", 
    "I want to see the revenue for all and not just for our sales, and", 
    "this time I want to break it by the manufacturers.", 
    "Actually I added the manufacturers to the product table so", 
    "I can choose it from here.", 
    "So I\u2019m not really concerned now about making it really nice", 
    "looking and playing with all the properties and the design.", 
    "You can go and select styles and I like, personally,", 
    "the black one but you might like something else.", 
    "There\u2019s a lot of options to make this prettier but", 
    "I want to concentrate more on the functionality.", 
    "Now probably what I want is also to add a bunch of slicers so", 
    "that the person who was using this dashboard can actually", 
    "control it and slice on different things.", 
    "So I can go again to the fit list, and", 
    "let\u2019s say I want a slicer by year.", 
    "So I\u2019m opening the calendar, in the calendar I have", 
    "some hierarchy that I will explain in a moment what it is.", 
    "But for the moment I will just pick from the other fields which are not", 
    "part of the hierarchy.", 
    "I will pick the year and add it as a slicer.", 
    "So, here it is as a slicer.", 
    "You see that the calendar table has more years in it", 
    "than actually there\u2019s data.", 
    "So there\u2019s data only from 2011 to 2015, so", 
    "the years which don\u2019t have any data are shown here in the bottom,", 
    "I can also make them disappear if I want to.", 
    "So now when I click on it, it does affect the chart, but", 
    "it affects only one chart and not the other.", 
    "The reason is that I started the slicer", 
    "from the context of this specific chart.", 
    "If we want to make this slicer connect to the other chart,", 
    "I will have to go either through the options for the slicer,", 
    "go to Report Connections, and check the other chart", 
    "in my worksheet which is currently named Sheet3.", 
    "It\u2019s actually a good idea to go and name the charts and the pivots and", 
    "give them meaningful names so it will be easier", 
    "to know what slides are connected to which pivot table or pivot chart.", 
    "Now that I did that, when I click on years, you probably", 
    "notice that both charts respond to my clicking on the slicer.", 
    "And I might have more slicers, and", 
    "some of the slicers might affect all pivot charts, and", 
    "some of the slicers may affect just a subset of the pivot charts.", 
    "Slicers can also be connected to elements like pivot charts and", 
    "pivot tables, which actually reside even on other worksheets,", 
    "not necessarily this one.", 
    "So it could be a whole network of elements like pivot tables,", 
    "pivot charts and slicers in different worksheets.", 
    "I mentioned before, hierarchies, let\u2019s take a look at that.", 
    "In order to see the definition of a hierarchy and", 
    "explain a little bit what it is, I will go and", 
    "look at the Manage window and switch to the diagram view.", 
    "If you remember, the diagram view is a view in which", 
    "I see the relationships between the tables and I see all the tables.", 
    "And also, it\u2019s the location in which I can actually see, or define,", 
    "new hierarchies.", 
    "So for example, the calendar table that I created through the automatic", 
    "tool in Power Pivot already have a hierarchy, name, date hierarchy.", 
    "So hierarchy is a collection of fields, here it\u2019s year, month,", 
    "and date, that they actually naturally go together.", 
    "So usually you go and you drill from year to month to date.", 
    "So if you define those three together,", 
    "then when you move them to the pivot they go together.", 
    "And then it\u2019s easier to go and start by clicking on the plus sign,", 
    "drilling from year to month, from month to date and so on.", 
    "And as you saw before,", 
    "we also have drilling experience on the pivot charts.", 
    "You can create your own hierarchies,", 
    "sometimes they are natural like here.", 
    "I also have on the locations table,", 
    "I have a hierarchy called GEO which is country, state, and city.", 
    "In theory I could actually create any arbitrary hierarchy and not", 
    "just those natural ones which are like geographic one and the time.", 
    "Because there\u2019s an advantage,", 
    "if there\u2019s a specific way to drill - a drill path that is repeating itself,", 
    "it may be a good idea to add it as a hierarchy to one of the tables.", 
    "Let\u2019s go back to Excel, and now I want to explain", 
    "a little bit about the other option to show and", 
    "to visualize data which is not pivot tables and not pivot charts.", 
    "And those are the cube functions.", 
    "So, if you\u2019ve seen before", 
    "someone showing cube functions probably what they did is this way.", 
    "They created a pivot table, so", 
    "let me create a new pivot table right in the bottom here,", 
    "and let me choose Measure.", 
    "Maybe this, and something on,", 
    "let\u2019s say, drag the Geo hierarchy.", 
    "So you notice when I drag the Geo to hierarchy,", 
    "I actually can now immediately start drilling from", 
    "countries to state and to cities and okay I have this.", 
    "Now let\u2019s have something on filter.", 
    "Or actually, you know what,", 
    "let\u2019s connect this pivot to the existing slicer by year.", 
    "To do that, I can go either to the options as I saw before,", 
    "of the slicer and connect it to the new pivot.", 
    "I can also go to the pivot, and from the special UI for", 
    "the pivot I can go to something called Filter Connections and", 
    "say that I want to connect this pivot to a slicer called Year.", 
    "That I have a few of them because I have also others in other worksheets", 
    "but this one is the one that I am looking at in the Sheet3.", 
    "When I click OK, now the pivot is connected also to this.", 
    "So once I have this pivot, I can actually go, and", 
    "again from the analyze area in the ribbon, I can go somewhere called", 
    "OLAP Tools and I can use something called Convert to Formulas.", 
    "When I did that,", 
    "actually the area in which the pivot used to be looks almost the same.", 
    "Only that actually I lost the drilling capability, but every one", 
    "of the cells is now actually as you see in the formula bar.", 
    "It is a formula, there is no pivot anymore.", 
    "And the formula is using each one of the sales used here,", 
    "one of the cube functions.", 
    "There are seven of them and now I will show you, so", 
    "I was able to convert the pivot into a bunch of formulas.", 
    "Notice that the formulas still are calculated when I click on", 
    "the slicer.", 
    "So, they actually reference the slicer and", 
    "I can continue to control them with the slicer.", 
    "Now there are seven cube functions.", 
    "I don\u2019t have really the time to go into detail and", 
    "I will provide some reference to material that you can learn more", 
    "about the cube functions, but let me do just a simple example.", 
    "So, one of the functions that is not used in the automatic", 
    "conversion is this one, the cube set.", 
    "And now when I use the cube functions the first", 
    "argument is always the connection name.", 
    "And you can just click on the double quote and", 
    "it will come and it\u2019s completed with tab.", 
    "Double quote again and now another double quote and", 
    "it lists the elements in the model", 
    "And now I can say, for example,", 
    "that I want to go the product dimension and", 
    "I want to get manufacturer and all manufacturers.", 
    "And now actually I\u2019m writing something that is not,", 
    "I added something manually which is the function .children.", 
    "This function is actually a MDX function.", 
    "MDX is the language that we use to connect to OLAP cubes.", 
    "Those functions were created back in 2007 to be used exclusively with", 
    "OLAP cubes.", 
    "It\u2019s another technology that is a predecessor of the model technology", 
    "that we saw in Excel.", 
    "But now we can actually reuse it against the model that we", 
    "have in Excel.", 
    "So, if you want to do a little bit of more advanced stuff and", 
    "not just convert pivot tables to functions,", 
    "you have to know a little bit of this MDX language.", 
    "So, now I can give it a name and I can call it Manufacturers.", 
    "And now once I have this,", 
    "actually in this cell I have the list of all manufacturers.", 
    "And with another function,", 
    "I can start calling the members there one by one.", 
    "So I can refer to this cell absolutely and", 
    "then say give me member number one.", 
    "And now I can copy it over and", 
    "say now I want member number two from the set.", 
    "And once I have them, let me just complete the example by", 
    "adding a cube member function, which is just bringing a specific member,", 
    "either a measure, or from any other area in the model.", 
    "In this case I want a Measure, I want to say that the Measure", 
    "is OurSales.", 
    "And here I can use a function called CUBEVALUE", 
    "that is actually will be using this member here.", 
    "But not only this one, so it will use the name of the manufacturer,", 
    "and there\u2019s a variable number of parameters.", 
    "So, it will use also this element and", 
    "it will actually use it this way.", 
    "And it will also use the slicer, which is Slicer_Year, let\u2019s go 1.", 
    "So once I\u2019ve done, apparently there is no data for this one.", 
    "But in this way I can actually", 
    "refer to different elements.", 
    "And by doing this I can build, and", 
    "this will be similar to the ones that are generated automatically.", 
    "But now I can make it any shape or form that they want, and", 
    "this is the main advantage of this thing.", 
    "I could always do something like cut and paste them somewhere else,", 
    "which is something it would not be able to do if it was a pivot.", 
    "This is possible only because these are functions and", 
    "they are easy to move around and I can start building my reports.", 
    "And if you remember, when you open the material, you will see", 
    "an example called freestyle that is using those very extensively.", 
    "So, we saw a few options for visualizations.", 
    "We saw how to create a few pivot charts, connect them to one or", 
    "more slicers.", 
    "And we also saw some of the basics of creating cube functions", 
    "either by converting a pivot into functions or formulas,", 
    "or by doing manual creation of formulas.", 
    "Thank you and see you in the next module."
